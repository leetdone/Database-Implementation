This is a moderate solution to the real world problem.
In this database, I
•	Implemented a relational database based on MVC (model-view-controller) in C++ from scratch, which contains 5 object-oriented main systems (interpreter, command processing, storage, view, indexing)
•	Supported 12 types of SQL command, which performs the same as MySQL database (create, show, drop, use, insert, update, join, select, describe, delete, alert)
•	Integrated index and cashing based on hash tables to the database, increasing the selecting speed up to 80%
